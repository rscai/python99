# Layout a binary tree

## 題目

>Given a binary tree as the usual Prolog term t(X,L,R) (or nil). As a preparation for drawing the tree, a layout algorithm is required to determine the position of each node in a rectangular grid. Several layout methods are conceivable, one of them is shown in the illustration below.

>In this layout strategy, the position of a node v is obtained by the following two rules:
> * x(v) is equal to the position of the node v in the inorder
> * y(v) is equal to the depth of the node v in the tree sequence
>
>In order to store the position of the nodes, we extend the Prolog term representing a node (and its successors) as follows: 
>
>% nil represents the empty tree (as usual)
>% t(W,X,Y,L,R) represents a (non-empty) binary tree with root W "positioned" at (X,Y), and subtrees L and R 
>Write a predicate layout_binary_tree/2 with the following specification: 
>
>% layout_binary_tree(T,PT) :- PT is the "positioned" binary tree obtained from the binary tree T. (+,?)

>Test your predicate in an appropriate way. 

題目很清楚，為二叉樹中的每一個節點標記X，Y。X等於中序遍歷二叉樹時該節點的序號；Y等於該節點所處的深度。

用單元測試描述為：

[include](../../../tests/btree/p413_test.py)

## 解題思路

先中序遍歷二叉樹，標記X。因為節點在X軸上不能重疊，所以需要在遍歷過程中共享一個增長序列。即在每一次子樹遍歷時，傳入增長序列，若使用了序列則增長該序列，並將增長後的序列返回，以便傳給下一個子樹遍歷過程。

然後再遍歷二叉樹一次，標記Y。Y等於節點的深度，根節點深度記為1。從根節點可始遍歷時，深度為1。遞歸遍歷左右子樹時，深度加1，依此類推。

代碼實現：
