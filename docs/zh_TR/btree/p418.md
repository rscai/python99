# Dotstring representation of binary tree

## 題目

>We consider again binary trees with nodes that are identified by single lower-case letters, as in the example of problem 4.16. Such a tree can be represented by the preorder sequence of its nodes in which dots (.) are inserted where an empty subtree (nil) is encountered during the tree traversal. For example, the tree shown in problem 4.16 is represented as 'abd..e..c.fg...'. First, try to establish a syntax (BNF or syntax diagrams) and then write a predicate tree_dotstring/2 which does the conversion in both directions. Use difference lists. 

用單元測試描述為：

[include](../../../tests/btree/p418_test.py)

## 解題思路

先建立dotstring的BNF。

```bnf
<tree> ::= . | <letter> <tree> <tree>
```

一棵樹可能是空樹也可能不是空樹。當為空樹時表示為`.`。當不為空樹時，由根節點`<letter>`和左右子樹組成。

Dotstring的編碼很簡單。前序遍歷二叉樹，遇到節點即輸出節點字符，遇到空樹則輸出`.`。

代碼實現：

[include](../../../python99/btree/p418.py)
