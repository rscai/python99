 # Nonograms

## 題目

>Around 1994, a certain kind of puzzles was very popular in England. The "Sunday Telegraph" newspaper wrote: "Nonograms are puzzles from Japan and are currently published each week only in The Sunday Telegraph. Simply use your logic and skill to complete the grid and reveal a picture or diagram." As a Prolog programmer, you are in a better situation: you can have your computer do the work!

>The puzzle goes like this: Essentially, each row and column of a rectangular bitmap is annotated with the respective lengths of its distinct strings of occupied cells. The person who solves the puzzle must complete the bitmap given only these lengths.

Problem statement:          Solution:

          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 3         |_|X|X|X|_|_|_|_| 3           
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 2 1       |X|X|_|X|_|_|_|_| 2 1         
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 3 2       |_|X|X|X|_|_|X|X| 3 2         
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 2 2       |_|_|X|X|_|_|X|X| 2 2         
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 6         |_|_|X|X|X|X|X|X| 6           
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 1 5       |X|_|X|X|X|X|X|_| 1 5         
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 6         |X|X|X|X|X|X|_|_| 6           
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 1         |_|_|_|_|X|_|_|_| 1           
          |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| 2         |_|_|_|X|X|_|_|_| 2           
           1 3 1 7 5 3 4 3             1 3 1 7 5 3 4 3              
           2 1 5 1                     2 1 5 1  

>For the example above, the problem can be stated as the two lists [[3],[2,1],[3,2],[2,2],[6],[1,5],[6],[1],[2]] and [[1,2],[3,1],[1,5],[7,1],[5],[3],[4],[3]] which give the "solid" lengths of the rows and columns, top-to-bottom and left-to-right, respectively. Published puzzles are larger than this example, e.g. 25 x 20, and apparently always have unique solutions. 

## 解題

將二維表格以線性的列表表示，MxN的表格表示為長度為$$M \times N$$的列表。用迴溯法探索列表中所有元素的標記組合，邊探邊排除不符合約束的組合。剩下的即為可行解。
