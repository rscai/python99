>The particular crossword puzzle is specified in a text file which first lists the words (one word per line) in an arbitrary order. Then, after an empty line, the crossword framework is defined. In this framework specification, an empty character location is represented by a dot (.). In order to make the solution easier, character locations can also contain predefined character values. The puzzle opposite is defined in the file p7_09a.dat, other examples are p7_09b.dat and p7_09d.dat. There is also an example of a puzzle (p7_09c.dat) which does not have a solution.
>
>Words are strings (character lists) of at least two characters. A horizontal or vertical sequence of character places in the crossword puzzle framework is called a site. Our problem is to find a compatible way of placing words onto sites. 
>
>Hints: 
>1. The problem is not easy. You will need some time to thoroughly understand it. So, don't give up too early! And remember that the objective is a clean solution, not just a quick-and-dirty hack!
>2. Reading the data file is a tricky problem for which a solution is provided in the file p7_09-readfile.pl. Use the predicate read_lines/2.
>3. For efficiency reasons it is important, at least for larger puzzles, to sort the words and the sites in a particular order. For this part of the problem, the solution of 1.28 may be very helpful.

## 解題

空白方格框是二維的，但如果把每一組連續的空格（應由一個單詞填充的一組空格）作為一個單元，則整個方格框可以表示為一個列表，列表中每個元素都是一組連續空格。

再使用迴溯法從後選單詞集中取出單詞填充每一組連續空格。符合要求（同一個位置填充的字母一定是相同的）的填充組合即為解。

### 代碼實現

[include:14-](../../../python99/misc/p709.py)

使用迴溯法列出所有的組合。在列出組合的同時，可以判斷排除不符合要求的組合。按照規則，有些單詞的字母位置是重疊的。這就要求填充在這些位置的字母是相同的。

[include:-11](../../../python99/misc/p709.py)

最後，將解轉換成字迷表格形式，方便人類閱讀。
